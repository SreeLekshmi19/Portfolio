# ðŸ’¼ Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, developed to showcase my professional journey, technical skills, and selected projects. The portfolio serves as a central hub where recruiters, collaborators, and potential clients can learn more about my background, explore the work I've done, and get in touch for opportunities.

The website is thoughtfully designed with a focus on clarity, responsiveness, and user experience. It includes the following key sections:

- **About Me**: A brief overview of my background, interests, and goals as a developer.
- **Projects**: A curated selection of my projects, complete with descriptions, live demos, and source code links.
- **Skills & Technologies**: A comprehensive list of tools, languages, and frameworks I have experience with.
- **Contact**: Direct contact information and links to my professional profiles.
- **Resume**: An option to view or download my most recent resume.

The portfolio is built using modern web technologies and follows best practices for accessibility, performance, and responsive design. It is continuously updated as I grow and expand my skill set.

Feel free to explore the source code, check out the live demo, and connect with me via the contact section. Thank you for visiting!
